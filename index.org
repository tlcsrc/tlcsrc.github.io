#+title: TLC SRC
#+subtitle: Built with TLC

The Systems Research Centre[fn:1] that takes [[https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/][computational trinitarianism]] seriously---the triplet of /Types/, /Logic/ & /Categories/.

Ultimately, we want to build elegant software systems that are reliable, maintainable, and composable---as well as being fun to write! We resist the temptation to compromise the principles of TLC in order to pursue high performance[fn:2].

[fn:1] Named in homage to the original SRC, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Systems_Research_Center][DEC SRC]].
[fn:2] We do like low-level bit-twiddling tricks, it's just that we prefer to get things right before we make them fast. In the long-term, we believe that high-level principled design will lead to the leveraging of the an ever broader range of low-level bit-twiddling in a safe, verified manner for high performance and high confidence.
